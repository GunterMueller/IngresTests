	   4-Apr-1996   (clate01)
			Modified canons to ignore sepcc
           3-Aug-1998	(popri01) Move "remove"'s out of main processing to
			eliminate spurious DIFS; especially on re-run. Use
			new SEPPARAM settings (see runstar).
	  27-Dec-1999 	(vande02)
                        Added empty canon to confirm db sql connection
	  19-Sep-2007 	(boija02)
			Trying to reduce compiler warnings. Renamed sdrstub.c to
			better reflect its content & changed return type to void
			when functions don't return anything.
