	  16-09-93     barbh
		       Changed SEPPARAM_DDB to SEPPARAMDB. This makes the
		       star test consistent with testkit standards.
          24-Apr-1995	(saimi02)
			Changed version # of the star database.
	  12-Dec-1995	(saimi02)
			Modified version # of the star database from 1.1 to 1.2.
	  26-Jun-1998	(vande02)
			Added alternate canons for 'help table' 
			version string II2.0 
	  22-jan-99 (stephenb)
			New canons for 2.5
	  27-Dec-1999 (vande02)
                        Added empty canon to confirm db sql connection
       30-Jan-2003 (hanch04)
               Updated canons to match Ingres 2.6/0303
               Service Pack 2
       04-Feb-2003 (hanch04)
                update to run again 2.6/0303 and previous SP
       11-Nov-2007 (kiria01) b119410
