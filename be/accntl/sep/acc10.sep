	Purpose	: setup test for dba07 - dba41 tests
	Input Files  : none
	Output Files : none
	Database     : grantdb
	Tables       : none
	Synopsis     :creates grantdb database and creates users pvusr1,pvusr2,
		      pvusr3, roles pvusr1_role, pvusr2_role, pvusr3_role, and 
		      groups pvusr1_group, pvusr2_group, pvusr3_group.

	History: 30-JUL-1991	Created		Jpark		Author

		14-nov-1991 (lauraw)
			Changed the "destroydb" so it is run by superuser
			"ingres" rather than "pvusr1". This way, the test
			won't fail if an earlier version of grantdb exists
			that is owned by somebody else.
		30-Jul-92 (GordonW)
			Don't use hard-coded DB name. Use the correct
			SEPPARAMDB  symbol
		19-feb-93 (camacho)
			Took out the accessdb part of the test since it was
			not needed and diffed because of the 6.5 changes to 
			the interface.

		11-May-1993 (camacho)
			Changed the destroydb command to be run by 
			pvusr1 rather than ingres. Ingres does not 
			have permission to destroy anyone's database.

          30-Aug-1993	(garys) updated canon to accept slight difference in
				createdb message for 65.
	  07-jan-1994   (sandhya) took out -s option from destroydb as
			it is no longer supported.  Doesn't affect the
			test in anyway.
	  01-feb-1995	(oertel) added grant role to public to 
			allow use of pvusr1_role, pvusr2_role, pvusr3_role. 
	  03-Mar-1998 (vissu01) changed qasetuser pvusr1 destroydb SEPPARAMDB3
			destroydb SEPPARAMDB3 because database was created
			during initialization as testenv so you cannot drop
			as pvusr1 so the next step qasetuser pvusr1 createdb
			SEPPARAMDB3 fails and consequently acc10.sep does not
			create groups and grants permissions which results in
			the acc37 and acc43 to fail, since no groups exists
	04-Aug-1998 (popri01) Re-add "qasetuser pvuser1 destroydb SEPPARAMDB3"
			as handoffQA does not run an initialization script,i
			but leave the previous change as well.  This should
			ensure that grantdb gets destroyed no matter what the
			initialization condition.
        09-15-1999 (kamra01) deleted the comment " (yu$pe02) Hard code pagei
			size to 2K." since there is no page size in this test.
