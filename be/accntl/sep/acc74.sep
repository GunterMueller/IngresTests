Purpose :tests whether an unprivileged user can create/alter/drop roles
Input Files :none
Output Files:none
Database    :iidbdb
Tables      :iirole
Synopsis    :	Requires that a user 'pvusr2      ' exists which has neither 
		super user nor update syscat privileges. 
		Test assumes the id of 'pvusr2      ' and then connects to 
		iidbdb. Issues in turn 'create role','alter role' and 
		'drop role' statements. None should work.

History :converted by rch	Created: 4.4.90		Author :Ralph Harnden
	 Modified by Steve Rees  6-Nov-1990.
          16-Nov-1993	(garys)	Updated canon to accept 1) additional
				column info on select * from iiuser; 
				system catalog changed for 65, 2) 65
				create/alter/drop role error messages.
          31-Jan-1995	(Oertel) Took new canon for new columns in iiuser.
           3-Mar-1995	(oerde01)Modified 'select * from iiuser..' to more
				 informative 'select security, maintain_users,
				 from iiusers where user_name...' to prevent
				 diffs on flags_mask.
