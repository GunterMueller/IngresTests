 History: 18-Jan-1996	(seran01)	Created
          11-Nov-1996	(Author)
	  24-Mar-1999   (vande02) Hard-coded VPG_SZ to 8K
	  12-Feb-1999	(kamra01) added comment that path diffs can be ignored
          29-Mar-2001	(BOIJA02) Didn't test for the bug, used an unneccessary
			alternate db, had non-descriptive object names. Fixed 
			those problems, added some cleanup.
          29-MAR-2000	(BOIJA02) VMS tokenises directory only, NT directory +
			filename, so we need alt vms canons for the copy.*
			commands.
          25-May-2001	(BOIJA02) 2.5 specific update to oping20 XIP
          24-Aug-2001   (BOIJA02) Xing to main +2.6 specific tweaks
          30-Jan-2003   (hanch04) Updated canons to match Ingres 2.6/0303
                        Service Pack 2
          04-Feb-2003   (hanch04) update to run again 2.6/0303 and previous SP
          23-Jun-2004	(wu$ca01) Correct the table name from t1 to utl19 in
                        the create table command. As a result of the above
                        correction, update all CANONs in this test. Replace
                        utildb with SEPPARAMDB. Remove the extra copydb canon.
           8-Oct-2004	(vande02) Copydb now displays information on sequence
			objects.  Replacing copydb canon with r3 results.
			See issue 13707841 and change 470386
           5-Aug-2005	(vande02) Backing out above change from 8-Oct-2004. Fix
			to bug 114150 means sequences are no longer generated
			by copydb when a table name has been passed to copydb
			from the command line.  This is expected in some 2.6
			patches but not in r3 yet.
          30-Jan-2006	(boija02) Updated copyright info for Ingres Corp.
	04-Feb-2007	(smeke01) b118877
		Added -n flag to verifydb because testenv does not have write
		permissions to the II_CONFIG directory.

S_DU17FC_TABLE_PATCH_WARNING	WARNING:

   VERIFYDB operation TABLE (or XTABLE) can result in loss of user data when
   run in any mode except REPORT.  It will also modify the table to a heap
   and remove all secondary indices on the table.  This program is designed as
   a last-ditch attempt to recover a user table.  It is intended only for use
   by Computer Associates technical support representatives.
   It is NOT supported.  You assume all risk if you use the program.

   If you do use the TABLE or XTABLE operation, it is recommended that you
   backup the table's disk file before continuing.
