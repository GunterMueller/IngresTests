        Test ID : qp308
        Module  : BE/QRYPROC
        Filename: qp308.sep
        Purpose : To test use of default decimal type sequences
        Input Files  :
        Output Files :
        Database     : SEPPARAMDB
        Tables       : None
        Synopsis     : This test will verify use of decimal sequences
                       using various values and boundaries for each
                       parameter of the sequence. It will also contain
                       some destructive tests as well. This test is
                       similar to qp307.sep except that it uses decimal
                       sequences only and tests maximum boundaries of
                       the default decimal (decimal(5)) values. 

** Error-handling test cases:
**
**   Error if sequence has reached boundary and NOCYCLE is set
**   Error if CACHE is set to 0
**
** NOTE: Test cases contain a mixture of both ANSI (2 word) and Oracle
**        (1 word) options such as the following:
**
**      ANSI                            ORACLE
**
**      no minvalue                     nominvalue
**      no maxvalue                     nomaxvalue
**      no cache                        nocache
**      no cycle                        nocycle
**      no order                        no order
**
**      next value for seq_name         seq_name.nextval
