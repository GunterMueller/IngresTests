	Purpose	: Test nested dbproc binding and grant execution privileges.

	Tables       :
	Synopsis     : Drop and recreate a calling dbproc to test binding of
		       the most current dbproc.  Must have grant option on
		       all nested dbprocs to grant execution privileges on
		       parent dbproc and drop a nested dbproc and check that
		       all execution privileges on the parent dbproc are 
		       dropped.

 History: 11-Nov-1993	(malee)	  Created
          13-Dec-1993	(malee)	  add set autocommit on instead of intermittenly
				  using the commit statements.
          17-Dec-1993	(malee)	  update the canon to reflect the bug b58075.
	  14-mar-1994	(sandhya) Help procedure bar message changed. We
				  now have the user testenv's name in the
				  procedure definition.  Previously, it
				  was "create procedure .....; execute 
				  procedure foo;end."  Now we have "create
				  procedure ....; execute procedure "testenv"
				  . foo; end."
	  31-mar-1994	(malee)	  Update the canon as a result of b58075 fix.
				  Per Andre, when you drop foo(), QPs of both 
				  foo() and bar() get dropped.  Subsequently,
				  when execute bar(), DBMS tries to recreate
				  bar() and discovers that foo() no longer
				  exists.
          18-Dec-1995	(raora02) Accepted alternate canons because output
				  message for 'help procedure' has changed.
           4-Oct-2001   (devjo01) Change canons to reflect new procedure
				  permission behavior.
           2-Nov-2006	(vande02) Updated to new help procedure format, header
				  corrections, and Copyright.
