	Test Name: qp267.sep
	Time: Wed Jan 31 10:12:13 1996
	User Name: testenv
	Terminal type: septerm
 
	Test ID : (qp267.sep)
	Module  : be/qryproc
	Filename: qp267.sep
	Purpose	: To test for bug 34308.  Commit statement in a dbp will not
		  always close open cursors.  If the cursor's select has a
		  "select distinct" or "order by" clause, the cursor will
		  remain open after a dbp (called inside the cursor fetch
		  loop) issues a commit statement.  After the last row is
		  fetched, a LIBQ error occurs: E_LQ0059 "Unable to start
		  up 'fetch C1' command, Unexpected initial protocol".
	Input Files  : qp267.sc
	Output Files : none
	Database     : SEPPARAMDB (qryprocdb)
	Tables       : curstbl
	Synopsis     : This sep compiles the .sc and creates an executable which,
		       when ran, tests the bug described above.  If the output is
		       as described in the canon, the bug doesn't exist.  But if
		       the output consists of the four names and ages inserted
		       into curstbl, which will diff, of course.
