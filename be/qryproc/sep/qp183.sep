	Module  : 
	Filename: ela08.sep
	Purpose	: Test 200 rules on one table. 201 is raiserr so rollback. 
	Input Files  : none
	Output Files : none
	Database     : SEPPARAMDB
	Tables       : dul,l log
	Synopsis     : Create 200 rules on a table and update table.
			look at log to see what happened. Create 201
			that raises an error and rollsback all the
			transaction. Look at log again.
