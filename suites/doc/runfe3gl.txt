        13-oct-04 (marwi08) Removing references to compiler
                            environment variables (for ADA, FORTRAN, etc.)
                            and known issues. This is for Ingres open
                            source.
        15-oct-04 (legru01) File needed additional changes to make it
        		    somewhat consistent with other .txt files.

	This document describes:

	 A.   The environment variables used by this script.
	 B.   The execution process.
	 C.   Tables showing the databases, database variables, setup
              scripts, output location and .lis file names needed for
              each facility. 	
	 D.   Monitor progress of front-end 3gl test

 A.  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

     ING_TST  This variable points to the top of your testing area
              structure.  This variable must be set in order to
              execute this script.  This variable should be set in
              your environment setup file.
 
     TST_CFG  This variable points to the location of the .cfg files.

		UNIX: $ING_TST/suites/acceptst
		WINDOWS: %ING_TST%\suites\acceptst

     TST_SHELL This variable points to the location of the shell files
	       
	      	UNIX: $ING_TST/suites/shell
              	WINDOWS: %ING_TST%\suites\bat
			
     TST_OUTPUT This variable has been set in the environment setup
              	file. This script will use this variable to point to
	 	the location of the test output files generated by
		this script. Your test output will be directed to:
		
		UNIX: $TST_OUTPUT/embed
		WINDOWS: %TST_OUTPUT%\embed

 B.  EXECUTION PROCESS:
     Find out from the machine administrator what compiler has
     been installed and if the compiler is supported for your
     testing project.

     1. Initialize the databases.

	The script can be executed in two ways: a) in its entirety, or b) by
	facility.	    

	    a) To initialize all the 3gl databases, do the following:

		UNIX: 	 % sh $TST_SHELL/runfe3gl.sh init all
		WINDOWS: > %TST_SHELL%\runfe3gl init all

	    b) To initialize a single 3gl database, do the following:	

		UNIX:  	 % sh $TST_SHELL/runfe3gl.sh init 3gl1|3gl2 
		WINDOWS: > runfe3gl init 3gl1|3gl2 

	The following databases will be created:

		personnel
		gourmet

     2.  Execute the script.

         The script must be executed by facility:

		UNIX:    % sh $TST_SHELL/runfe3gl.sh 3gl c 
		WINDOWS: > runfe3gl 3gl c

C.  ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION BY FACILITY:

              Database     Database   TST_LISTEXEC  TST_ROOT_OUTPUT
Facility      Variable       Name     LIST FILES    OUTPUT FILES 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
c         | SEPPARAMDB     personnel  fe3glc.lis    fe3glc.rpt, *.log,*.out
          | SEPPARAMDB2    gourmet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

D.  MONITOR PROGRESS OF FE 3GL TEST:

      Open 3 windows to view the performance of the test:
      
	1. To execute the commands to run the test suite
      
	2. Watch the errlog.log file
           (located in II_SYSTEM/ingres/files)
                  
      		UNIX/WINDOWS: 
      		tail -f errlog.log

       	3. To monitor the test progress, go to 
      	   (located in TST_OUTPUT/embed/suitename)

      		UNIX/WINDOWS:
            	tail -f [any output file named above in section C.]
