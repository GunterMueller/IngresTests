	This document describes:

        A.   Net setup for UNIX using the script or manually
        B.   Net setup for WINDOWS using the executable or manually

***NOTE: You must perform the Ingres/Net setup BEFORE running any of the
	 following test suites:
	 
	 STAR Phase1	(runstar.sh or runstar.bat)
	 NET		(runlbnet.sh or runlbnet.bat)
	 Replicator	(runrep.sh or runrep.bat)

 A. NET SETUP FOR UNIX:
    There are two approaches to complete the Net setup: 

    1) Using the following shell script as user 'testenv' and provide the
       requested information as the prompts appear:

       % sh $TST_SHELL/netsetup.sh

    2) Manually: 
       Copy the netutil.setup to your $TST_OUTPUT:

         % cp $ING_TST/suites/userenv/netutil.setup $TST_OUTPUT

       Edit the netutil.setup file appropriately:

         % vi $TST_OUTPUT/netutil.setup

       a) Change <localnode> to your machine's name (i.e. usilsu77)
       b) Change <listen_address> to your installation code (i.e. II)
       c) Change <passwd> to either the 'testenv' password or the installation
	  password if you installed ingres with an installation password
       d) The protocol will default to tcp_ip 
       e) Save the netutil.setup file

       As user 'testenv' run the Net utility and use your input file as follows:

         % netutil -file $TST_OUTPUT/netutil.setup

       When the above has successfully completed, verify the vnodes you just
       created in your installation can make connections using netutil:

         % netutil

       Select each vnode on the list, and choose 'test' from menu.  You should
       get a message saying the connection was successful.  If the connections
       fail, check the following:

	a) Check if your platform has Shadow Passwords or C2 Security
           enabled.  A file will exist in the /etc directory named 'shadow' if
	   this option is enabled.  If Shadow Passwords are enabled, then you
	   must compile executable 'ingvalidpw.'

        b) Perform the following procedures to compile ingvalidpw:

	   ->kill iigcn process (Name Server)
	   ->su 'root'
	   ->csh
	   ->cd $II_SYSTEM/ingres/bin 
	   ->set path=($II_SYSTEM/ingres/{bin,utility} $path)
	   ->mkvalidpw
	   ->exit as root
	   ->ingstart -iigcn

        c) Then retest that each vnode can make connections as 'testenv'
	   using netutil.

	d) If Bridge server (iigcb) is running, then the listen_address for
	   vnodes will be a 3 character code. In the II_CONFIG/errlog.log
	   file search for iigcc port id. It will be the installation code
	   and numeral one.

 B. NET SETUP FOR WINDOWS:
  
    There are two approaches to complete the Net setup: 

    1) Using the following executable as user 'testenv' and provide the
       requested information as the prompts appear:

         > %ING_TST%\suites\bat\NETSETUP.BAT

    2) Manually: 
       Copy the netutil_wnt.setup to your TST_OUTPUT directory.

	  > copy %ING_TST%\suites\userenv\netutil_wnt.setup %TST_OUTPUT%
   
       Edit the file netutil_wnt.setup appropriately:
       
       a) Change <localnode> to your machine's name (i.e. usilsu77)
       b) Change <listen_address> to your installation code (i.e. II)
       c) Change <passwd> to either the 'testenv' password or the installation
	  password if you installed ingres with an installation password
       d) Change <protocol> to tcp_ip
       e) Save the netutil_wnt.setup file

       As user 'testenv' run the Net utility and use your input file as follows:

         > netutil -file %TST_OUTPUT%\netutil_wnt.setup

       When the above has successfully completed, verify the vnodes you just
       created in your installation can make connections using netutil:

         > netutil

       Select each vnode on the list, and choose 'test' from menu.  You should
       get a message saying the connection was successful.

       If you encounter a problem with the file netutil_wnt.setup during the
       setup, perform the following workaround:

       As user 'ingres' run netutil:

         > netutil -file %TST_OUTPUT%\netutil_wnt.setup

       And, as user 'testenv' run netutil again:

         > netutil -file %TST_OUTPUT%\netutil_wnt.setup

Reset: If the setup is successful, you do not need to reset the Ingres/Net 
       configuration during a whole testing cycle.  The vnodes and configuration
       parameters will be stored in your Ingres installation. However, if any
       parameters such as Ingres user account names or passwords change during
       testing, or you reinstall Ingres, you will have to rerun the Ingres/Net
       setup again.
