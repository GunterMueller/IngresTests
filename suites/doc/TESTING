This document will guide you through the environment setup process required 
prior to running automated test suites from the Ingres Acceptance test.
Use this document along with the Test Checklist found in
ING_TST/suites/doc/testchecklist.txt.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

DO NOT INSTALL INGRES IN A DIRECTORY PATH WITH SPACES!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRE-TESTING SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS ONLY:

	Ingres acceptance tests were executed with one of the
	following third party software package installed. 
	
	1. Cygwin (Opensource product) version 1.5.10-3
		http://www.cygwin.com
	
	2. MKS (Licensed product) Release 6.1
		http://www.mks.com

	If using the Cygwin software package, locate the /usr/bin/grep.exe
	file. Make a copy of it then rename that copy to /usr/bin/egrep.exe
	
	Add the /usr/bin directory to your local search path. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the Appendix in this document for brief descriptions of the
environment variables used throughout this document.

============================================================================

1. INITIAL DIRECTORY SETUP:

 _____ a. The tests and testing tools provided and built along with Ingres
          should now be in place.

 _____ b. The following operating system users must be created on your test
          machine before running the automated test suites.  These accounts
          should be solely used for testing Ingres and should not be part of
          any 'group' that has access to any critical data.

               ingres
               pvusr1
               pvusr2
               pvusr3
               pvusr4
               testenv

          For WINDOWS, the following permissions must be set for all the
          users above.

                       d. Power Users -> user ingres only
                       e. Replicator -> user ingres only
                       f. Users - > (all users)

                 26.Click on OK from the 'Select Users or Groups' window and
                    click OK again from the 'Properties' window

                 27.The password for user 'ingres' by default is 'ingresnt.'
                    This can be overridden by the environment variable
                    QASETUSER_INGRESPW. If any of the above criteria is not
                    met, execution of 'qasetuser' will fail.


 _____ c. All tests MUST be run by the 'testenv' login, unless otherwise
          indicated.  It is suggested you do not 'su - testenv' because
          this will reset the path variables, so it is preferred to log on
          to the test machine as 'testenv' and then run test suites.

 _____ d. You must have at least 1 GB available on a file-system for the 
          ING_TST area.  Here is an example:

               ING_ROOT
                |-- tstinst
                |	|-- ingres
                |	|-- output
                |-- tools
                |-- tst

          What the directories contain:

                tstinst/ingres/ Full Ingres installation for acceptance testing
                tstint/output/  Test results and testing tool working directory
                tools/          Ingres test tool executables
                tst/            Ingres test tool source and test scripts



2. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND PATHS:


 _____    Source this script to set up the Ingres test environment:

          UNIX/LINUX:	   
               as "testenv"
               source ING_ROOT/tst/suites/userenv/tstenv

          The first time this script is sourced, you will be prompted for
          certain "primal" environment settings.  Once entered and verified,
          settings will be stored as ~/.tstenvrc.  Settings can then be tweaked
          by editing the rc file.  Many of these settings are historic
          holdovers which allow other shell scripts to locate certain
          components.  Others have perfectly good default values.  Unless you
          have unusual requirements, it is generally best to leave most of
          these settings alone.

          If you want to change the Ingres installation used for testing, you
          can source this script with a --reset parameter, keep the old
          settings, and simply change the value for II_SYSTEM.

          usage: . tstenv [ --reset | -r| --force | -f ]

          where:       --reset, or -r will regenerate the parameter file.
                       --force, or -f will override parameter file checks.
                       --help, or any invalid input will get this message.

          WINDOWS:

               Make a copy of the file below then edit its contents according
               to the comments within the file 'tstenv.bat' before executing
               it.

               as "testenv"
               > ING_ROOT\tst\suites\userenv\tstenv.bat



3. INGRES TESTING TOOLS:


_____    After the tools have been built, they will contain directories:
         bin, files, and man1.  These tools should be in the tools directory
         under ING_ROOT/tools.



4. CONFIGURING THE SERVERS AND INCREASING THE INGRES TRANSACTION LOG:

 _____ a. For the operating system to accept the following test configuration,
          it may be necessary to increase the maximum allowable size for
          shared memory segments. You can do this by running the following:

          LINUX:
               as "root"
               /sbin/sysctl .w kernel.shmmax=<new value>

          A value of 256000000 is suggested for testing Ingres.  The change
          is immediate and does not require a reboot.
 
 _____ b. The Ingres Transaction Log must be at least 200 MB in order for the
          Back-end Ingres Acceptance tests to run successfully.  Stop your
          Ingres test installation, destroy the default transaction log,
          create it with a size of 200 MB, then startup your installation.



5. INGRES OPERATING SYSTEM USERS/PASSWORDS (UNIX/LINUX only):

 _____ a. For machines using shadow passwords the /etc/shadow file will exist.
          The "mkvalidpw" utility must be executed as "root" to create the
          "ingvalidpw" program and set the installation-wide variable,
          II_SHADOW_PWD. If shadow passwords are enabled and "ingvalidpw" has
          not been compiled, Net connections using vnodes will not validate
          the user/password and connections will fail.

 _____ b. Compile "ingvalidpw":

               as "ingres"
               su -m root
               mkvalidpw
               exit

          If your installation is currently running, stop and restart it after
          compiling "ingvalidpw."

 _____ c. If your test machine is NOT using shadow passwords and the
          "ingvalidpw" program was compiled in error, this environment setup
          will cause unpredictable results with Ingres Net tests.  To correct
          this situation unset the installation-wide variable that enables the
          use of shadow passwords:

               as "ingres"
               ingunset II_SHADOW_PWD

          If your installation is currently running, stop and restart it after
          unsetting II_SHADOW_PWD.


6. SET PERMISSIONS ON QASETUSER (UNIX/LINUX only):

 _____    The qasetuser program is used throughout the automated testing
          suites to run commands with the effective user id of the test
          logins.  For qasetuser to work, it must be owned by root, with the
          set-user-id bit set.  To set the correct ownership of qasetuser:

               as "root"
               cd $ING_TOOLS/bin
               chown root qasetuser
               chmod 4755 qasetuser

          Test to make sure qasetuser is working properly:

               as "ingres"
               qasetuser testenv whoami

          If 'testenv' is not echoed back to your screen display, then
          qasetuser is not working correctly.  You will need to fix
          qasertuser before running any tests.



7. FINAL TEST SETUP STEPS:

 _____    Before initiating any of the test suites, you must modify some of
          the configuration parameters as listed below which are stored in
          the config.dat file.  Run the tstsetup.sh script.
 
          *** DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT IN BATCH OR BACKGROUND MODE -
              IT REQUIRES RESPONSES TO PROMPTS ***

          UNIX/LINUX:  
              as "ingres"
              cd $TST_OUTPUT
              sh $TST_SHELL/tstsetup.sh

          If the 'tstsetup.sh' displays any messages regarding 'qasetuser' NOT
          being setup correctly, review Section 'SET PERMISSIONS ON QASETUSER'
          above.

          WINDOWS:
              as "ingres"
              > %TST_SHELL%\tstsetup.bat

          The following configuration changes will be performed by tstsetup.sh
          or tstsetup.bat:

              a. Modify some configuration parameters stored in config.dat.
              b. Turn on all the cache sizes in your DBMS server.
              c. Stop and restart the Ingres installation.
              d. Create the Ingres user accounts necessary for testing.
              e. Give Ingres user 'testenv' the same NET privileges as'ingres'
              f. Setup your Ingres/Net assignments (vnodes).



8. RUN INGRES ACCEPTANCE TEST SUITES AND REVIEW RESULTS:

 _____    Proceed with running acceptance test suites by reviewing
          the ING_TST/suites/doc/testchecklist.txt.



APPENDIX -  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND DEFINITIONS

For your reference, here is a brief description why these variables are needed:

CLASSPATH   Holds the JDBC class path under your Ingres test installation.

II_SYSTEM   Points to the top-level directory containing your run-time Ingres
            installation.

ING_TST     Points to the top-level directory containing the Ingres test tool
            source and the entire test files directory structure.

ING_TOOLS   Points to the directory containing the executables needed to run
            SEP tests.  The tools contain these directories: bin, files, and
            man1.  Included in these tools is the automated testing
            program SEP (Send-Expect Process).

SEP_DIFF_SLEEP 
            Some platforms cannot diff automated tests as fast as other
            platforms. The default within sep of 250 milliseconds will affect
            how fast (or slow) SEP will run.
            
SEPPARAM_JPASSWORD
            Holds the password for test user ID 'testenv' for JDBC tests.

SEPPARAM_JUSER
            Holds the test user ID used by the JDBC tests.

SEPPARAM_URL
            Holds the JDBC URL used by the JDBC tests.

SEPPARAM_ODBCLIB
            Fully qualified path to the ODBC Driver manager shared library.

SEPPARAM_OPASSWORD
            Holds the password for test user ID 'testenv' for ODBC tests.

TERM_INGRES The terminal type setting used by Ingres front end and character
            Based tools: (UNIX) setenv TERM_INGRES vt100fx
                         (WINDOWS) set TERM_INGRES = ibmpc
            The terminal type vt100 is used in Unix under some circumstances.

TST_CFG     Points to ING_TST/suites/acceptst.  This directory contains the
            configuration files for each suite (*.cfg), which directs SEP on
            how to run the automated tests.

TST_DOC     Points to location ING_TST/suites/doc which contains detailed
            testing documentation on how suites are run.

TST_INIT    Points to location ING_TST/basis/init which contains the
            Driver.sc and other initialization files used by some SEP tests.

TST_LISTEXEC Points to ING_TST/suites/acceptst (same place as TST_CFG).  
             This directory contains the list files for each suite (*.lis)
             which directs the LISTEXEC program in SEP on what tests are 
             included in a particular suite, and in what order they should be
             run. 

TST_ROOT_OUTPUT
TST_OUTPUT  Points to the directory that will store your test results.  SEP
            will use this area to create temporary work files while it runs
            the automated tests, and will clean them up when finished if the
            processes are not interrupted.  SEP will also store all your
            report, *.log, and *.out files here.

TST_SEP     Points to ING_TOOLS/files which are files needed by SEP.

TST_SHELL   This should point to location - ING_TST/suites/shell which
            contains the Bourne shell scripts used to initialize databases
            and run each test suite. For WINDOWS, this should point to
            ING_TST\suites\bat contains the batch scripts.
