Ingres ODBC Driver Testing Instructions

History
-------
  14-Jul-2004 (sarjo01) Created.
  12-Aug-2004 (sarjo01) DSN name changed to testdsn.
  06-Oct-2004 (legru01) Added an instructions to create a System DSN
  			for usage with Windows. And changed execution
  			script from ".sh" to ".bat."
  24-Apr-2007 (vande02) Changed Step 2 to 2a and added 2b so the Ingres/CLI
			ODBC Driver will be used with Icebreaker testing.
			Changed Cshell syntax to BASH style.
 

Introduction
------------
This document describes the procedures for testing the Ingres ODBC Driver
for Windows, Linux and Unix systems using the Ingres Acceptance Tests.  


--------------------------------------
 Instructions for UNIX, Linux Systems
--------------------------------------

  1. The ODBC Driver Manager 
  --------------------------
The Ingres ODBC Driver for UNIX and Linux requires the use of an ODBC Driver
Manager. The Driver Manager is a software package that is often included in
the OS distribution. Alternatively, a recommended ODBC Driver Manager for many
Unix and Linux platforms can be obtained from http://www.unixodbc.org/. 

  2a. Setting the variable SEPPARAMDB_ODBCLIB 
  -------------------------------------------
When the ODBC Driver Manager has been installed, set the variable
SEPPARAMDB_ODBCLIB to point to the fully qualified location of the Driver
Manager library file. Example:

	% export SEPPARAM_ODBCLIB=/usr/lib/libodbc.so

The name and location of this library may vary depending on the OS platform
aNd version of the installed ODBC Driver Manager.

  2b. rPath and Icebreaker Setting the variable SEPPARAMDB_ODBCLIB
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
The Ingres/CLI ODBC driver can be used to test ODBC with Icebreaker instances
in the rPath environment.  Set the SEPPARAM_ODBCLIB like this:

	% export SEPPARAM_ODBCLIB=$II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib/libiiodbcdriver.1.so
 
  3. Creating the ODBC Data Source 
  --------------------------------
The ODBC data source is a named resource describing the database that an ODBC
application will connect to. The data source used by the Ingres ODBC Driver
Acceptance Test is created as follows:

     a. Execute the ODBC Test setup script:

        % sh $TST_SHELL/runodbc.sh init

     This command creates the Ingres database used by the tests, and also
     creates the test output directory, $TST_OUTPUT/net/odbc.

     b. Create an ODBC data source file in the test output directory:

        % vi $TST_OUTPUT/net/odbc/odbc.ini

     This text file should contain the following lines:

        [ODBC Data Sources]
        testdsn=Ingres

        [testdsn]
        Driver=  (see NOTE below)
        DriverType=Ingres
        Server=(local)
        Database=odbcdb
        ServerType=Ingres

     NOTE: The line beginning with "Driver=" should contain the fully
     qualified file name and path (with no environment variables) of the
     Ingres ODBC Driver file included in the Ingres installation. By default,
     this file is located in $II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib. Example:

        Driver=/ingresinstallations/II/ingres/lib/libiiodbcdriver.1.so

  4. Setting the variable ODBCINI 
  -------------------------------
Set the variable ODBCINI to point to the odbc.ini file created in the previous
step:

       % export ODBCINI=$TST_OUTPUT/net/odbc/odbc.ini

  5. Setting the variable SEPPARAM_OPASSWORD
  -------------------------------
Set the variable SEPPARAM_OPASSWORD to tester password.
step:

       % export SEPPARAM_OPASSWORD=@user password

  6. Running the Ingres ODBC Driver Test Suite
  --------------------------------------------
When the previous setup steps Have been completed, the ODBC Driver tests can be
executed as follows:

       % sh $TST_SHELL/runodbc.sh odbc

Test results will be written to the directory $TST_OUTPUT/net/odbc.


----------------------------------
 Instructions for Windows Systems
----------------------------------

  1. Initializing the Test Environment 
  ------------------------------------

Execute the ODBC Test setup script to create the test database and output
directory:

        c:\> %TST_SHELL%\runodbc.bat init
        c:\> set SEPPARAM_OPASSWORD=@user password

  2. Creating the ODBC Data Source 
  --------------------------------
On Windows systems, ODBC data sources are created using the Windows ODBC
Data Source Administrator, an application that is included with the OS. On
Windows XP, this application is located in the Administrative Tools folder. 
The instructions here assume Windows XP is the target system. The Data Source
Administrator on other versions of Windows may require slightly different
steps.

    a. Load the Data Source Administrator. Click the "System DSN" tab
       If there is already a data source (DSN) with name "testdsn" 
       and Driver "Ingres 3.0", highlight it and then click Remove.
    b. Click Add...
    c. Scroll down and select "Ingres 3.0" from the driver list, then
       click Finish.
    d. In the form that is now displayed, fill in these fields:

       Data Source: testdsn
       Database:    odbcdb
    
    e. Click Apply.
    f. Click Test. A message should appear stating that the test connection
       was successful. Click OK.
 
  3. Running the Ingres ODBC Driver Test Suite
  --------------------------------------------
When the previous setup steps have been completed, the ODBC Driver tests can be
executed as follows:

	c:\> %TST_SHELL%\runodbc.bat odbc

Test results will be written to the directory %TST_OUTPUT%\net\odbc.
