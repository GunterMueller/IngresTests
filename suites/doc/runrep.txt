         A.   The environment variables used by this script.
         B.   The execution process.
         C.   Tables showing the facility name, databases, database

              needed for each facility.
         D.   Monitor Progress of Replicator Test

A.  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
 
        REP_TST         This variable points to the top of your testing area
                        structure.  This variable must be set in order to 
                        test Replicator and should be set in your environment
			setup file.  Normally it is set as for ING_TST.
			
				UNIX	% setenv REP_TST $ING_TST
				WINDOWS	> set REP_TST=%ING_TST%

       	TST_ROOT_OUTPUT This variable has been set in the environment setup
			file. The runrep will use this variable to point to
			the location of the test output files.  Your test
			output will be directed to:

				UNIX	$TST_ROOT_OUTPUT/rep
				WINDOWS	%TST_ROOT_OUTPUT%\rep
                                
        TST_CFG         This variable points to the location of the .cfg 
        		files. Normally set as for other automated tests:

                                UNIX	$TST_CFG/suites/acceptst
				WINDOWS	%TST_CFG%\suites\acceptst
		
	TST_SHELL       This variable points to the location of the shell 
			files and bat files
			
			        UNIX	$TST_SHELL/suites/shell
				WINDOWS	%TST_SHELL%\suites\bat

B.  EXECUTION PROCESS:

    1. Configure INGRES/NET.

	You must have INGRES/NET configured for Replicator testing.  The 
	easiest way to do this is by executing the netsetup.sh script for
	Unix or the netsetup.bat batch file for Windows. Vnode replnode will
	be set up which is used by this suite.
	    
	If you have already successfully executed the following script
	as 'testenv':

        	UNIX:	 % sh $TST_SHELL/netsetup.sh
		WINDOWS: > %TST_SHELL%\netsetup.bat

       	you can proceed with the step 'Initialize the databases'. If not,
	refer to file ING_TST/suites/doc/netutil.txt to setup the required
	virtual node.

    2. Setup Replicator Servers as Services (WINDOWS PLATFORM ONLY)
	
	You must have INGRES/NET configured for Replicator testing.

       	In order to run the automated Replicator tests, ten Replicator
	servers must be started as services and the user passwords reset
	on these ten services with the following steps:

       	From a command window, remove any previous Replicator services
	and start 10 new services.

                 As 'testenv'
                 > repinst remove
                 > repinst 10

                 Change the login password for each of the 10 new services.

                 Click Startup>Settings>Control Panel>Admin Tools>Services.
                 Locate the first Ingres Replicator service and RIGHT
                 click it. Select Properties then the Log On tab. 
                 Reset the password to be ca-testenv for each Ingres
                 Replicator service.
                 
                 *** NOTE: The password MUST be ca-testenv and nothing else ***
                 
    3. Initialize the databases.

	The script can be executed in two ways: a) in its entirety, or b) by
	facility.

	a) To initialize ALL databases:

	       	UNIX:	 % sh $TST_SHELL/runrep.sh init all
		WINDOWS: > %TST_SHELL%\runrep.bat init all
 
	b) To initialize selected database, choose the modules shown
	   between the pipes:

	     	UNIX:	 % sh $TST_SHELL/runrep.sh init |backup|benign
							|branch|repmgr
	
	     	WINDOWS: > %TST_SHELL%\runrep.bat init |backup|benign
						       |branch|repmgr
	
    	The resulting output of the initialization can be found in

	     	UNIX:	 $TST_ROOT_OUTPUT/rep/repinit.out
		WINDOWS: %TST_ROOT_OUTPUT%\rep\repinit.out

         The following databases will be created:

		repdb1
		repdb2
		repdb3
		repdb4
		repdb5

    4. WINDOWS ONLY: Increase the psf_memory and opf_memory parameters
	    as needed through CBF eg. increase to 10000000.  

    5. Execute the script.

	The script can be executed in two ways: a) in its entirety, or b) by
	facility.

	a) To execute the script in its entirety: 

		UNIX:	 % sh $TST_SHELL/runrep.sh rep all
		WINDOWS: > %TST_SHELL%\runrep.bat rep all
 
	b) To run selected test modules, choose the modules shown
	   between the pipes:

		UNIX:	 % sh $TST_SHELL/runrep.sh rep |backup|benign
						       |branch|repmgr
	
		WINDOWS: > %TST_SHELL%\runrep.bat rep |backup|benign
						      |branch|repmgr

D.  MONITOR PROGRESS OF REPLICATOR TEST:

      Open 3 windows to view the performance of the test:
      
	1. To execute the commands to run the test suite
      
	2. Watch the errlog.log file
           (located in II_SYSTEM/ingres/files)
                  
      		UNIX/WINDOWS: 
      		tail -f errlog.log

       	3. To monitor the test progress, go to 
      	   (located in TST_OUTPUT/rep/suitename)

      		UNIX/WINDOWS:
            	tail -f [any output file named above in section C.]
