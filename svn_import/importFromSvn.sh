#  Description:
#  ============
#    This tool is a very simple tool for automatically propping code
#    from subversion to git. Doing so allows people to choose their
#    choice of an either centralized or distributed model to work with
#    Ingres code. Particularly, git allows local branching, local commit
#    and thus lends itself well to experimental work and working offline.
#
#    This tool keeps a manifest of revisions it has successfully merged
#    and thus preserves state through comitting this file in the repository.
#
#    This tool could be modified to be generic fairly easily.
#
# History:
# ========
#      Jun-06-2010 (Andrew Ross)
#          Initial version.
#      Aug-26-2010 (Andrew Ross)
#          Updates to handle binaries better. Copy the changes over top rather
#          than apply patches.
#          Sped up the tool by only downloading files we care about.
#          Added proper support for deleted files.
#      Oct-16-2010 (Andrew Ross)
#          Forked to handle the tests.

# TODO:
# Generic improvements:
# =====================
# Urgent
# ------
# - use svn log on the URL to get the revision numbers of changes
#   that affected it. This is *much* more efficient.
# - Add error handling function with msg & return params
# - put the stuff we want to exclude into a file instead

# Minor
# -----
# - getopts for option handling
# - config file for defaults
# - add help/usage
# - consider syslog for logging
