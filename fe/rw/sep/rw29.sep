	Test ID : wha13.sep
	Module  : sreport sql
	Filename: wha13.sep
	Purpose	: Test the fix of bug 37360, II_DATE_FORMAT & CURRENT_DATE()
	Input Files  : date_rpt.rw (RW script)
	Output Files : date_rpt.rw 
	Database     : SEPPARAMDB -- tested on QATESTDB on Cuckoo and Swift
	Tables       : wha13
	Synopsis     : test the output of CURRENT_DATE() from Report Writer 
			after setting the environment variable II_DATE_FORMAT 
			to MULTINATIONAL.  The test connects to the database
			through SQL, drop table wha13, create table wha13,
			inserts a single record that is an integer, setenv
			II_DATE_FORMAT multinational, fill date_rpt.rw, 
			sreport SEPPARAMDB date_rpt.rw, report date_report,
			The CANON will diff because the value in the CANON
			is different than the value entered into the table.
			This is essential, the dates would not be compared
			by SEP. The is a comment associated with the CANON.

This screen will always DIFF because of testing the function CURRENT_DATE.
Check to insure that the FORMAT of the DATE returned is the same as the 
FORMAT of the DATE in the CANON.  The format should be ( dd/mm/yy ).

DO NOT change the number 5 that is in the CANON, that is what forces
the comparison to fail.  The dates would be ignored otherwise.
