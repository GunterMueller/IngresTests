	Synopsis     : While copying from a file into a table (i1, c2, i1, i1) 
		       I get a warning message E_CO0015 COPY: Warning: 4 c0 or 
		       text(0) character domains were truncated.  There are 
		       neither c0 nor text(0) columns in the table, if you do 
		       retrieve, the table looks identical to the file, so I 
		       did not expect any problems with this copy.  And what 
		       are "character domains"?
		       Related bug No.20335
	History	: Created by Olga Pekelny March 1, 1990

                        Changed SEPPARAMDB1 to SEPPARAMDB to follow testkit
                        conventions.

                        Took alternate canons for when this test is run as
                        part of the FE/STAR suite. Each canon is annotated.
                        Took alternate canons 1mainly because star does not
                        support QUEL.
