	Purpose	     : Test delimiters with i4, into and from using c0 and 
		       text(0).  sp and dash not tested because they are not 
		       good delims for numeric.  sp won't work because c0 
		       converts numbers to strings and pads blanks, these are 
		       found as sp delim.  Dash won't work because any minus 
		       sign will be recognized.

          14-Dec-1993	(Author)
          24-Aug-1993	(jpark)   Modified Moved all create table stmts to
				  initcopy.sep
          15-Dec-1993   (alices)  Modified 
                       		  . Checked in correct canons for 6.5. 
		       		  . Made modification to cha06l (copy1=c0) from
				    (copy1=i1) 
		       		  . Took out bulk copy 'cause if the file does
				    not contain bulk copy - () data, you cannot
				    copy data back by using bulk copy. copy
				    cha06l()from"cha06lb.dat"
	  13-Jan-1994	(barbh)   Changed SEPPARAMDB1 to SEPPARAMDB to follow 
				  testkit conventions.
          31-Jan-1994	(barbh)   Removed the IF (unix) from several canons.
				  This is not necessary. The canon is correct,
				  the alt canon is incorrect.
	   1-Feb-1994	(barbh)   Added new canon for 6.5 error msg returned for
				  illegal column type. Removed old canon - not
				  relevant for 6.5.
          29-Apr-1994	(garys)   Accepted new canon for E_AD2006 error message
				  extra line added to message.
          29-Mar-1995	(catem01) Took alternate canons for when this test is
				  run as part of the FE/STAR suite.  Each canon
				  is annotated.  Took alternate canons mainly
				  because star does not support QUEL.
	  04-Apr-1995	(catem01) Took out a grammatical error introduced during
				  29-Mar-95 updates.
          28-Apr-1995	(saimi02) Added alternate canons for Star Front End test
				  Those canons include error messgaes from star
				  database which does not support QUEL.
          13-Sep-1995	(parmi04) Added alternate canons for Star Front End 
			 	  test.This canons includes error messages for
				  quel which is not supported in star database.
          18-Jan-2007	(vande02) Updated canons for invalid copy input now that
				  error messages includes "E_C0002A Copy has
				  been aborted and E_US10CE includes date/time
				  text. History and header cleanup.
	  21-Dec-2009 (kschendel) Updated error message from premature EOF.
