	Test Name: lia03.sep
	Time: Thu Feb 10 13:13:10 1994
	User Name: testenv
	Terminal type: septerm
	Test ID : lia03
	Module  : abf
	Filename: lia03.sep
	Purpose	: Basic Test of IIEXPORT db blankapp to IIIMPORT db blankapp
		  (6.5)
	Input Files  : lia03bln.txt
	Output Files : none 
	Database     : SEPPARAMDB 
	Tables       : none
	Synopsis     : iiexport/iiimport w/ all supported flags 
		       from/to blank app should result in error
		       and lia03bln.tmp (intfile file) and
		       lia03bln.lis (list file) are not created.
	NOTE:	       Also there's several bugs that prevent me
		       from adding the correct canon (58571,59835)
		       Once these bugs are fixed, I'll revisit 
		       and update appropriate canon.
	History: 14-Feb-1994	(Uncharee)	Created
		 16-Feb-1994	(Uncharee)	Update to include all supported
						flags
		 17-Mar-1994	(Uncharee)	Test should now be portable on
						UNIX and VMS.
		 2-May-1994 	(fredv)		Correct some typos (specifed)
						which cause difs.
          16-Dec-1994	(Author)
		11-Feb-1997 	(vissu01)	Modified for NT
		 12-nov-1998	(walro03)
				Correct noisy diffs when backslash should be
				forward slash.
           3-Apr-2002	(BOIJA02) ING_TST/output won't necessarily exist and  
			II_TEMPORARY is defined by the standard QA setup, so 
			we'll use that as it is. Cleaned out superfluous NT 
			canon.  
          27-APR-2004	(syeto01) Added vms alternate canon to remove message 
                        diff.
          30-Jan-2006	(boija02) Updated copyright info for Ingres Corp.
